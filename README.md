## Univariate EDA

In this section, we delve into the characteristics of each individual feature in the dataset. The aim is to understand the basic distribution, central tendency, and spread of the data.

### Columns
A detailed description of each column in the dataset, including data types, unique values, and basic statistics. This helps in understanding the nature of the data we are working with.

### Histplot
Visualization of the distribution of each feature using histograms. This provides insights into the data's shape, skewness, and potential anomalies.

### Outlier Detection
Identification and analysis of outliers in the dataset. Outliers can significantly impact model performance, so this step is crucial for data preprocessing.

## Multivariate EDA

This section focuses on exploring relationships between multiple variables, aiming to uncover interactions and correlations that could inform our modeling approach.

### Columns
Analysis of pairs or groups of features to understand their relationships. This includes scatter plots, pair plots, and other visual tools.

### Checking the relation of Stroke with all the columns
Examining how each feature relates to the target variable (stroke). This involves comparing distributions, calculating statistics, and visualizing relationships to identify significant predictors.

### Correlation Matrix/Heat Map
A visual representation of the correlation coefficients between features. This helps in identifying multicollinearity and understanding the strength and direction of relationships between variables.

### Insights drawn from correlation matrix
Key findings from the correlation analysis, highlighting important relationships and potential redundancies in the data.

### Handling the missing value of bmi column
Strategies for dealing with missing values in the BMI column, such as imputation methods. Proper handling of missing data is crucial for maintaining dataset integrity.

### Handling the outliers of bmi column
Approaches for addressing outliers in the BMI data, ensuring that they do not skew the results of our analysis and model training.

## Main Modelling

In this section, we build and evaluate our machine learning models. The focus is on creating a robust and reliable predictive model for stroke detection.

### Creating Pipeline
Construction of a machine learning pipeline that automates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. This ensures a streamlined and reproducible workflow.

### Over-Sampling
Techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance in the dataset. This step is vital for improving model performance on minority classes.

### Cross-Validation
Implementation of cross-validation to evaluate model performance. This helps in assessing the model's generalizability and robustness by testing it on multiple subsets of the data.
